# Pilates Booking Project

This project is a small web application that lets a user sign up for a Pilates class.  
The system uses PHP, sessions, and a MySQL database.

## How it works
1. The user fills in their name, email and equipment option.
2. They choose a class type.
3. If they need equipment, they enter the amount.
4. The final page shows their details and asks them to confirm.
5. After confirming, the information is inserted into the database.
6. A separate page displays all bookings from the database
